                        very interesting. I did not enjoy it. A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me. They were
                        talking loudly. I got very angry. I could not hear the actors. I turned round. I looked at the man and
                        the woman angrily. They did not pay any attention. In the end, I could not bear it. I turned round
                        again. 'I can't hear a word!' I said angrily.‘It’s none of your business,' the young man said rudely.
                        'This is a private conversation!'.</h3>

                        morning. They were expecting a valuable parcel of diamond from South Africa. A few hours earlier,
                        someone had told the police that thieves would try to steal the diamonds. When the plane arrived, some
                        of the detectives were waiting inside the main building while others were waiting on the airfield. Two
                        men took the parcel off the plane and carried it into the Customs House. While two detectives were
                        keeping guard at the door, two others opened the parcel. To their surprise, the precious parcel was full
                        of stones and sand!</h3>

                        worked in a lawyer's office years ago, but he is now working at a bank. He gets a good salary, but he
                        always borrows money from his friends and never pays it back. Harry saw me and came and sat at the same
                        table. He has never borrowed money from me. While he was eating, I asked him to lend me twenty pounds.
                        To my surprise, he gave me the money immediately. 'I have never borrowed any money from you,' Harry
                        said, 'so now you can pay for my dinner!'</h3>
